# Python tools for time-lapse microscopy data


provides the basic operations to access time-lapse microscopy data of cells generated via TTT [Hilsenbeck2016] and associated tools
- basic navigation within the experiment (timepoints/positions ...)
- loading images, segmentation, normaliztion and quantification (not actually calculating them, but just loading) 
- handling of cell tracks etc...
